# RailwayTicketApplication-Java

We have implemented a Railway Apllication for ticket booking using multi-threading in Java.

The application will support several users at the same time. We have used wait and notify to avoid any inconsistency in availability of trains.

File streams have been used to prepare a chart for each train in the name of its ID containing customer and respective ticket details.

List collections are used to aggregate the train and ticket details.

We have also implemented dynamic pricing timer which will hike the price for each time the timer hits the limit time mentioned for the train.
